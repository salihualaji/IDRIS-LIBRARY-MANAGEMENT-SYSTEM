# IDRIS-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Objective

You have been tasked with developing a web-based library management system using
HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL designed to efficiently manage books and users,
providing a seamless experience for both administrators and users. The system will
include features for managing user accounts, book records, and book loans. There are two
user roles: 1) Admin – responsible for managing books and user accounts, and 2) User –
able to search for, borrow, and return books. The system's three core features are: 1) a
login system with role-based access, 2) CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
for books and user accounts, and 3) functionality for book loans and returns.
